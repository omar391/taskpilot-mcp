# Current Tasks

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE âœ…

All tasks have been successfully completed and moved to `done_2025-07-06.md`.

## Task ID: TP-014
- **Title**: Migrate from Vite/Bun to Rsbuild for Unified Build System
- **Description**: Replace Vite with Rsbuild for both UI development and MCP server bundling. Rsbuild offers better TypeScript support, faster builds, and unified configuration for monorepo architecture. Update all build scripts, configuration files, and development workflows.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Project completion (TP-013)
- **Status**: Done
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Notes**: SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED - Migrated UI from Vite to Rsbuild while keeping TypeScript compilation for server:
  1. âœ… Removed Vite dependencies and installed Rsbuild for UI
  2. âœ… Created rsbuild.config.ts with React plugin and path aliases
  3. âœ… Updated all package.json scripts to use Rsbuild for UI development
  4. âœ… Fixed deprecated config warnings (source.alias â†’ resolve.alias)
  5. âœ… Maintained TypeScript compilation for MCP server (Node.js ESM compatibility)
  6. âœ… Updated build script to copy data files and schema.sql
  7. âœ… Tested concurrent development workflow (dev:all) - both UI and server running
  8. âœ… Verified production builds work correctly
  9. âœ… Updated project documentation to reflect Rsbuild migration
  
  **Final Setup**: 
  - UI: Rsbuild 1.4 with React plugin, hot reload on port 5174
  - Server: TypeScript watch mode with file copying for assets
  - Unified development: `bun run dev:all` starts both concurrently
  - Build: UI uses Rsbuild, server uses TypeScript + file copying
- **Connected File List**: ui/package.json, ui/rsbuild.config.ts, package.json, .task/project.md, ui/tsconfig.json
