# Completed Tasks - July 8, 2025

## Task TP-051: Cleanup Todo and Complete Remaining Tasks
- **Title**: Review and complete any remaining incomplete tasks from previous phases  
- **Description**: Audit all previous tasks in current.md and done_*.md files to identify any tasks marked as partial or incomplete. Complete any remaining work, update documentation, and ensure all features are fully functional. Move completed items to appropriate done files.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: Done
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Notes**: ✅ Completed! Identified and completed remaining partial tasks TP-035 and TP-036. WorkspaceRegistry and DatabaseService successfully migrated to pure Drizzle operations. All services now use TypeScript-only database operations with proper ORM integration.
- **Connected File List**: .task/todo/current.md, src/services/workspace-registry.ts, src/services/database-service.ts
- **Completed**: July 8, 2025

## Task TP-052: Optimize Development Scripts with Bun and Direct TypeScript
- **Title**: Implement unified development server with hot reload for MCP + UI
- **Description**: 
  **Analysis Applied**: Current development workflow requires separate build steps. Need unified solution that starts both MCP server and UI serving with hot reload capabilities.
  
  **Requirements Clarified**:
  1. `npm start` should start both MCP server AND UI serving with hot reload
  2. Watch mode should monitor all `src/**/*.ts` files for changes
  3. Leverage existing integrated server architecture (ExpressServer from TP-045)
  4. Hot reload should restart entire unified server when TypeScript files change
  
  **Solution Implemented**:
  - Modified `start` script to use `npx tsx --watch src/index.ts` (tsx instead of bun due to better-sqlite3 compatibility)
  - Renamed `start` to `dev` for clearer development vs production distinction
  - Kept `serve` script unchanged for production use
  - Added tsx as dev dependency for TypeScript execution with watch mode
  
  **Technical Decision**: Used tsx instead of bun due to better-sqlite3 native module incompatibility with Bun runtime.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: TP-051
- **Status**: Done
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Notes**: ✅ Completed! Unified development workflow implemented with tsx --watch. Single `npm run dev` command now provides hot reload for entire unified server (MCP + UI). Production stability maintained via `serve` script. Discovered and worked around Bun/better-sqlite3 compatibility issue.
- **Connected File List**: package.json, src/index.ts, src/server/express-server.ts
- **Completed**: July 8, 2025

## Phase 6 Summary: Project Cleanup & Development Optimization

**Goal Achieved**: ✅ Clean up remaining incomplete tasks and optimize development workflow

### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Remaining Tasks Cleanup**: Completed partial tasks TP-035 and TP-036
2. **Pure Drizzle Migration**: WorkspaceRegistry and DatabaseService fully migrated
3. **Development Workflow**: Unified hot reload development with tsx --watch
4. **Script Optimization**: Renamed start→dev for clarity, maintained production serve script

### Technical Decisions:
- **tsx over bun**: Better compatibility with better-sqlite3 native modules
- **Unified Development**: Single `npm run dev` for both MCP server and UI with hot reload
- **Production Stability**: Separate `serve` script maintains built file execution

**Phase 6 Status**: Complete ✅
