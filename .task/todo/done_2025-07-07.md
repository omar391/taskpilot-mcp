# Completed Tasks - July 7, 2025

## Task ID: TP-015
- **Title**: Make workspace cards clickable for navigation
- **Description**: Implement clickable workspace cards on the home page that navigate users into workspace-specific pages. Currently workspace cards are display-only and need to be interactive to allow users to enter workspace contexts.
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Project completion (TP-014)
- **Status**: Done
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Completed**: 2025-07-07
- **Notes**: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
  
  **Implementation Summary:**
  1. ✅ Updated router structure with workspace-based routes `/workspace/$workspaceId/tool-flows` and `/workspace/$workspaceId/feedback-steps`
  2. ✅ Made both active and inactive workspace cards clickable using TanStack Router Link components
  3. ✅ Updated FloatingNav to be conditional - shows only in workspace context, hidden on home page
  4. ✅ Updated ToolFlowsPage and FeedbackStepsPage to extract workspaceId from route parameters
  5. ✅ All TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
  6. ✅ Manual testing confirms navigation works correctly from home page to workspace pages
  7. ✅ Floating navigation correctly appears only in workspace context
  
  **Code Quality**: Core functionality implemented correctly. Minor linting issues exist but are pre-existing architectural concerns (React Fast Refresh warnings) that don't affect functionality.
  
  **User Experience**: Users can now click workspace cards and navigate seamlessly into workspace-specific pages, establishing the foundation for workspace-centric task management.

## Task ID: TP-016
- **Title**: Implement conditional floating navigation (hide on home page)
- **Description**: Modify floating navigation to only appear when users are inside workspace pages. Remove floating nav from home page but show it on workspace-specific pages (Tasks, Tool Flows, Feedback Steps).
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: TP-015 ✅
- **Status**: Done
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Completed**: 2025-07-07
- **Notes**: ✅ COMPLETED AS PART OF TP-015 IMPLEMENTATION
  
  **Implementation Details:**
  - Updated `floating-nav.tsx` to use conditional rendering based on workspace context
  - Navigation only appears when `workspaceId` parameter exists in route
  - Home page shows no floating navigation (returns `null`)
  - Workspace pages show Tool Flows and Feedback Steps navigation items
  - Verified through manual testing of all routes
  
  **Code Quality**: Clean implementation using TanStack Router's `useParams` hook for workspace detection.
